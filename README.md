This game is written in JavaScript and uses HTML Canvas.

Here's the general setup of the game:
- The  game has a single screen with 8 rows of bricks, a paddle, and a ball. 
- If the ball touches the bottom of the screen, you lose a ‘life’. 
- After 5 lives, the game is over. 
- Every time the ball touches a brick, the brick disappears and the score increases. 
- The ball bounces off the paddle, the bricks, and the top, left and right edges of the screen.
