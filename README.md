In this GitHub repository, you'll find the index.html, style.css and script.js files you'll need to build this Breakout game.

To play it on your browser, please download all the files to your computer then drag the index.html file to your browser.

Here's the general setup of the game:
● The  game has a single screen with 8 rows of bricks, a paddle, and a ball. 
● If the ball touches the bottom of the screen, you lose a ‘life’. 
● After 5 lives, the game is over. 
● Every time the ball touches a brick, the brick disappears and the score increases. 
● The ball bounces off the paddle, the bricks, and the top, left and right edges of the screen.
